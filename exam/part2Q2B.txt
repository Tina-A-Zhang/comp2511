I think the most appropriate design pattern for this situation is Adapter pattern. Adapter pattern is used when we have a class (Client) expecting some type of object and we have an object (Adapter) offering the same features but exposing a different interface. It allows two unrelated interfaces to work together. In this case, it help the application to able to read data in XML format, and not broken the application.
